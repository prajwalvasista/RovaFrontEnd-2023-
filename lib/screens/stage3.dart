        Cucumbers need moderate nitrogen and high phosphorus and potassium, so an organic plant food with the first number lower than the last two (like 3-4-6) is good. Keep plants well-watered to avoid bitter-tasting cucumbers.

        Cucumbers require different levels of nutrients at different stages of growth:
        - Growth: Cucumbers need more nitrogen during this stage.
        - Flowering and setting fruit: Cucumbers need more potassium during this stage.

        Some common nutrient disorders in cucumber plants include:
        - Potassium deficiency: This causes yellowing between the veins of the oldest leaves.
        - Boron deficiency: This causes yellow streaks and corky markings on the fruit.
